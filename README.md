# Cloudmart

Day 1
On Day 1, I worked on setting up Terraform using Claude as an AI assistant. I created an S3 bucket and DynamoDB tables, launched an EC2 instance, and configured IAM roles for managing AWS resources.

Resources Used:
AWS Services: S3, EC2, IAM, DynamoDB
Tools & Technologies: Terraform, AWS CLI, Claude AI

Steps Performed:
1. Used Claude AI to Generate Terraform Code : Generated Terraform code for an S3 bucket
2. Created an IAM Role for EC2 : Created an IAM role named EC2Admin with AdministratorAccess attached.
3. Launched an EC2 Instance :
Used Amazon Linux 2 AMI
Attached the EC2Admin IAM role
Enabled SSH access
4. Installed Terraform on EC2 Instance
5. Created and Applied Terraform Configuration
6. Created DynamoDB Tables for CloudMart
